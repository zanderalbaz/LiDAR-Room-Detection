# LiDAR-Room-Detection
 Take LiDAR data, process it, and run it through a deep CNN to classify different rooms. If we have time, we will port our code onto a raspberry pi, and strap it to a drone. We only plan on getting to the data collection phase of this part of the project, but ideally, we will teach the drone how to avoid objects, and detect much more than just rooms.
